3. Pull the latest code (containing bugged code)
4. Start Debugging
5. Try to add comments for each big fix ypu've done.
6. Commit & Push the final code before deadline

#### Steps after submission:

## Bugs

1. Empty Todo text should not be allowed to save
2. Text  not clearing in edit text after successful save
3. Todo Number (i.e. Index + 1) not showing in list
e.g. 1. First Todo
	2. Second Todo
4. Delete func not working
5. Ask for dialog confirming , Are you sure want to delete {todoText} ?
6. Clicking anywhere on the list item should open a dialog box showing the same todoText & a button to delete it and a button to close that dialog box
7. If todos list is empty, instead of showing empty list, show a text that says the list is empty, and add a todo to see the list
8. Change the Icon of the App(any icon would do)
